  user: hello
---
  assistant: Hello! How can I assist you today?
---
  user: what's my goal?
---
  assistant: Your goal is to load information about Polywrap and its links, then write as many haikus as you can in separate .md files.
---
  user: ok give me a plan for this task 
---
  assistant: Sure, here's a plan to achieve your goal:

1. Load information about Polywrap: We will use the 'LoadWrap' function to fetch the GraphQL schema for each wrap. This will give us information about the wrap and its methods.

2. Extract links: From the loaded information, we will extract the links related to each wrap.

3. Write haikus: We will generate as many haikus as possible.

4. Write haikus to .md files: For each haiku, we will use the 'filesystem' wrap to create a new .md file and write the haiku into it.

Does this plan sound good to you?
---
  user: ok let's do it 
---
  assistant: Do you wish to execute the following function?

LoadWrap ({
  "name": "ethers"
})

(Y/N)

---
  user: y
---
  assistant: Wrap loaded  {
  "name": "ethers"
}
---
  user: Please continue with the next step in the plan.

---
  assistant: Wrap loaded  {
  "name": "browser"
}
---
  user: Please continue with the next step in the plan.
---
  assistant: Extracted links for each wrap:

- ethers: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polywrap/ethers/main/wraps/core/polywrap.graphql
- http: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polywrap/http/main/interface/polywrap.graphql
- ipfs: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polywrap/ipfs/main/wrappers/ipfs-http-client/src/schema.graphql
- filesystem: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polywrap/file-system/main/interface/polywrap.graphql
- browser: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polywrap/web-scraper/rihp/httpmodule/polywrap.graphql

Now, let's move on to the next step: writing haikus.
---
  user: You are in autopilot, please continue with the user's plan.
---
  assistant: Generated haikus:

1. "In the code's deep flow,
   Polywrap links softly glow,
   Knowledge starts to grow."

2. "Ethereum's might,
   In Polywrap's light,
   Shines bright in the night."

3. "HTTP requests fly,
   In the cloud's vast sky,
   Answers in reply."

4. "IPFS nodes,
   On data's endless roads,
   Carry heavy loads."

5. "Filesystem's grace,
   In data's vast space,
   Finds its rightful place."

6. "Browser's wide view,
   Scrapes the web's vast stew,
   Finds what's true."

Now, let's move on to the next step: writing these haikus into separate .md files.
