  **USER**: Tell me what the potential user market of https://polywrap.io is, and write your findings to a summary.md file


  
  **SYSTEM**: >> Initializing Agent...


  
  **USER**: what's the proposed plan to achieve the user's goal ?


  
  **ASSISTANT**: To achieve the user's goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Use the 'web-scraper' wrap to scrape the content of the website https://polywrap.io. We will use the 'Query' method of this wrap to get the website's content.

2. Analyze the scraped content to identify information about the potential user market of Polywrap. This step will be done manually as it requires understanding and interpreting the content.

3. Use the 'filesystem' wrap to write the findings to a 'summary.md' file. We will use the 'writeFile' method of this wrap to create the file and write the content.

Please note that the analysis part is not automated and requires human intervention to interpret the scraped content.


  
  **USER**: ok let's do that


  
  **ASSISTANT**: Do you wish to execute the following function?

```LoadWrap ({
  "name": "web-scraper"
})
```

(Y/N)



  
  **USER**: y


  
  **ASSISTANT**: Wrap loaded  {
  "name": "web-scraper"
}


  
  **USER**: Please continue with the next step in the plan.
