  **USER**: what is the process you implemented and what are the results ?


  
  **ASSISTANT**: Sure, I can explain the process I implemented and the results obtained.

Process:
1. I identified that the user's goal was to get the Bitcoin price from a specific URL. This is a task that involves making an HTTP GET request, so I chose to use the "http" wrap.
2. I loaded the "http" wrap to understand its available methods and their signatures. This is done using the LoadWrap function.
3. After loading the wrap, I found that it has a method called "get" which is used to make HTTP GET requests. This method requires two arguments: the URL to fetch data from, and a request object that specifies details about the request.
4. I then invoked the "get" method of the "http" wrap using the InvokeWrap function. I passed the URL provided by the user and specified that the response type should be "TEXT".

Results:
The InvokeWrap function returned a response object with the following properties:
- status: 200, indicating that the request was successful.
- statusText: "OK", also indicating that the request was successful.
- headers: An empty object, indicating that no additional headers were returned in the response.
- body: A string containing the response body. This is a JSON string that contains information about the current Bitcoin price in USD and BTC.

The Bitcoin price in USD at the time of the request was 30,757.8149.
